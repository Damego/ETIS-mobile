# Expo Brownfield

A **brownfield** app is an existing native iOS or Android app that adopts React Native incrementally, as opposed to a **greenfield** app that is React Native from day one.

Expo supports two distinct ways to add React Native to a brownfield project:

| Approach       | What ships to the native app                                        | When to choose                                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Isolated**   | Prebuilt AAR / XCFramework                                          | Native team doesn't need Node or RN tooling; RN code can live in a separate repo |
| **Integrated** | React Native sources added to the existing Gradle / CocoaPods build | One team owns everything; comfortable with RN tooling; wants a single build      |

For the full decision matrix, see [./references/comparison.md](./references/comparison.md).

## Pick an approach

Use these quick rules — fall through to `comparison.md` for anything ambiguous.

- **Choose isolated** if the iOS/Android team must consume RN as a regular library dependency (AAR or XCFramework), without installing Node, Yarn, or the React Native build toolchain.
- **Choose isolated** if RN code and native code live in separate repositories or release on independent cadences.
- **Choose integrated** if a single team owns both the native and RN code and is willing to add React Native + Expo to the native project's Gradle and CocoaPods setup.
- **Choose integrated** if you want hot reload and JS source maps to work seamlessly inside the existing native build process.

## References

- ./references/brownfield-integrated.md -- Add RN and Expo directly to existing Gradle and CocoaPods builds (ReactActivity, RCTRootView, Podfile)

## Shared prerequisites

Both approaches require, in the environment that _builds_ the React Native side:

- **Node.js (LTS)** — runs the Expo CLI and JavaScript code.
- **Yarn** — manages JavaScript dependencies.

The integrated approach additionally requires **CocoaPods** on iOS (`sudo gem install cocoapods`). The isolated approach does **not** require CocoaPods or any RN tooling in the consuming native app.

## Versioning note

**Expo SDK 55 is the minimum supported version for brownfield integration.** Earlier SDKs lack `expo-brownfield`, the required `ExpoReactHostFactory` / `ExpoReactNativeFactory` entry points, and the current autolinking surface. When creating the Expo project, always pin the SDK explicitly:

```sh
npx create-expo-app@latest my-project --template default@sdk-55
```

Pin the same Expo SDK across both the RN project and any embedded dependencies.

## Submitting Feedback
If you encounter errors, misleading or outdated information in this skill, report it so Expo can improve:
```bash
npx --yes submit-expo-feedback@latest --category skills --subject "expo-brownfield" "<actionable feedback>"
```
Only submit when you have something specific and actionable to report. Include as much relevant context as possible.
If an AI agent repeatedly failed or the user had to take over an Expo task, load the expo-skill-feedback skill and follow its eval-candidate flow instead of reusing the command above.
